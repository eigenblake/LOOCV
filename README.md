# LOOCV
This is a homework assignment for a PhD level Microeconometrics course
at North Carolina State University. The "Wage" dataset contains hourly
wage and ASVAB score, a proxy used to approximate ability. In this
assignment, I use leave-one-out cross validation to estimate the
relationship between ASVAB score and wage. Please note the
"Mean_Squared_Errors.m" file and the "wage.xlsx" file must be uploaded to your MATLAB
directory, or the objective function will not run.
